# BBLog

Google Apps Script logging library

This builds on the work of [Peter Hermann's BetterLog](https://github.com/peterherrmann/BetterLog) to provide:

- Logging to a GSheet, Firebase DB, and StackDriver
- Multiple logging levels
- Multiple logging instances
- Logging of function names and line numbers (along with stack dump when used with [Assert library](https://github.com/andrewroberts/Assert))
- Log user's email address or ID, in a full or disguised format
